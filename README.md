## *A diary to document my cinephile journey*

**What will the application do?**

The application would serve as a diary to document personal experiences of films 
that a user has watched along with each film's name, release year, director, genre, 
rating, and service platform used to watch a film. While similar to letterboxed, this
application allows users to keep a private collection not visible to public or on the internet. 
Users can add films they have already watched to film collection, as well as, add or remove 
films they would like to watch in the future. Users will be able to sort films by name, 
release year, director, rating, platform used to watch the film.

**Who will use it?**

Cinephiles, academics, and motion pictures lovers who would like to keep a personalized
diary of films they have already watched or would like to watch in the future. Motion
pictures are an import part of our daily lives and make up for interesting conversations.
With the number of films a user watches over the years, it is easy to forget titles
of films a user liked while discussing films, recommending films to watch to friends, and while
a film scholar or student is studying a particular film genre or films with similar themes. This 
application would allow users to document and keep a track of their personal experiences of 
watching films.

**Why is this project of interest to you?**

As a cinephile myself, I watch a lot of films every year and often forget titles of films
I have already watched or titles of films I want to watch while discussing films with
other cinephiles. This application would also allow me to track how many films I
watch per year, and keep a diary of my cinephile journey.
